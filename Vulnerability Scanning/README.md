# Vulnerability Scanning Basics

## Overview
This section documents beginner-level labs focused on identifying exposed services and understanding basic vulnerabilities.

## Tools Used
- Nmap

## Key Concepts
- Open ports and services
- Attack surface identification
- Risk awareness

## Lab: Basic Nmap Vulnerability Scan

### Objective
Identify exposed services on a lab system and assess potential security risks.

### Environment
- Attacker: Kali Linux VM
- Target: Metasploitable2 VM
- Network: Host-only virtual network

### Tools Used
- Nmap (with several different variations)

### Methodology
- Performed basic port scan
- Conducted service and version detection
- Used Nmap scripts to identify potential vulnerabilities

### Key Findings
- Multiple open ports identified (FTP, SSH, HTTP)
- Outdated service versions detected
- Several services running without any access restrictions

### Security Impact
Exposed and outdated services increase the attack surface and may allow unauthorized access or exploitation.

### Mitigation Recommendations
- Disable unnecessary services
- Apply patches and updates
- Restrict access using firewall rules
- Enforce secure protocols

### Key Takeaways
This lab reinforced the importance of regular vulnerability scanning and understanding how exposed services con
